    "body" : "Project Rationale & Significance:\nEGI has world-class expertise on organic and inorganic geochemistry of fluids, rocks and minerals. We are applying our craft to develop new integrative tools to improve discovery and production of oil and gas from conventional and unconventional resources. These efforts compliment EGI projects dealing with shale gas characterization, basin modeling, iCORDS™, and tracer testing.\nAreas of New Research\nTrace metals in carbon-rich source rocks in terrestrial and marine sedimentary rock – This study involves geochemical characterization of trace metals in source rocks. One task will test the existence of geochemical zonation haloes around concentrations of gas and oil in unconventional reservoirs. A second task will test the potential of distinguishing global from local anoxia events in marine sediments.\nFormation water chemistry: fluid-rock interactions and fluid flow histories related to basin evolution, reservoir filling, and oil-gas recovery – This investigation centers on the chemistry of formation waters (gases) in and around productive hydrocarbons reservoirs. One task will test for the existence of aqueous geo-indicators that reflect thermal history, fluid flow, and porosity-permeability development. Another task will assess the potential of mineral deposition in pore space and pipe scales during production and reinjection.\nSecondary minerals, diagenesis and fluid flow in oil and gas basins – This work focuses on the role of fine scale diagenetic effects that transform porosity and permeability and control fluid flow in source and reservoir rocks.

    "body" : "EGI currently has over 15 shale gas\/oil related projects that are completed, underway or proposed, with more than 20 researchers actively engaged in these studies. Regarding Central Eurasian experience, EGI has completed 38 in-house reports since 1990. The database also includes 309 other reports. EGI has over 450 well logs (digital and paper), close to 60,000 km of seismic and almost 2,100 rock samples from wells or outcrop.\nModern concepts of shale stratigraphy indicate highly variable depositional conditions that lead to heterogeneous grain size, composition, and variable organic matter preservation. The Energy and Geoscience Institute has an established petrological analysis workflow with key instrumentation, hardware, software and personnel in place. This permits examination of shales from micro- to nano-scales, using thin section petrography, QEMSCAN®, XRD, SEM and FIB-SEM. The results allow for a comprehensive interpretation of composition, texture, fabric, porosity, permeability, micro-tectonics and diagenetic history. The petrologic results for this study will be both qualitative and quantitative.\nAn effort will be made to evaluate the shale source rock variability in a sequence stratigraphic framework to more realistically define“sweet spots”within major shale intervals. It is believed this approach and level of detail will have regional implications reflected in the shale parasequences and resultant stacking patterns that are detectable on well logs and hence important to define the resource extent geographically and its potential richness.",

The region includes the Lower Paleozoic shelf of the North American continent which has been affected by a series of tectonic collisions (fold-and-thrust belts) from Late Paleozoic through Eocene times, and upon which the Neogene Basin-and-Range extensional basins were superimposed.

A quantitative knowledge of the distribution of source rocks in space and through time has important implications not only for the global budget of hydrocarbon resources but also for evaluating the geologic conditions favorable for the generation of oil and gas on a basinal scale.\nAn enormous body of data on source rocks by new analytical techniques and from various basins around the world has been collected in recent decades. EGI, with its four decades of research work in various basins and regions of the world, holds an archive of thousands of reports and documents, which can constitute a valuable database on global source rocks. This research work is also timely in view of the recent trends in the industry to drill directly into source-rock targets. The project is to be conducted as an industry-funded research consortium. Given the wide scale, expectations and implications of the project, active participation of experts from the sponsoring companies in the project work is greatly encouraged.\nThe significance of this research project may be summarized in the following five key points:\n\t-The geospatial and temporal distribution of source rocks analyzed statistically and paleogeographically in this study has practical implications for the risk\/success evaluation of petroleum basins and identifying frontier or bypassed plays;\n\t\t-Sponsoring companies can augment their internal database on source rocks with the EGI database provided for in this project;\n\t\t-This research study attempts, in a holistic way, to decipher the fundamental controls resulting from tectonic, sedimentologic, geochemical, atmospheric and biotic processes, on the basinal deposition and preservation and the global distribution of hydrocarbon source rocks.\n\t\t-The Project will offer a new perspective on world basins classification and mapping based on source- rock deposition, rather than the present-day basin tectonic type. This will, in turn, generate new scheme to evaluate the relationship between basin type and hydrocarbon resources. ",

    "body" : "The ongoing research on petroleum systems at sheared margins has created new models, ideas and results that are breaking down barriers and opening up new and previously overlooked frontier regions. Phase 1 proved that sheared margins are an order of magnitude more complex than extensional margins. Instead of being similar everywhere along the strike of the margin, (a well-understood characteristic of extensional margins) sheared margins have well defined spatial and temporal distribution parameters. This fact makes each area locally unique from adjacent locales associated with the same margin.\nPhase 2 incorporates all basins of sheared margins (margin segments) worldwide, with special emphasis on the Equatorial Atlantic margin segments, the East Indian margin segments, selected South Atlantic margin segments, selected East African margins segments and selected West Australian margin segments.\nThe strategy is to define the significant controlling mechanisms and controlling factors to improve hydrocarbon exploration models available for sheared margins. We aim to develop a new and better appreciation of the factors controlling structural architecture and basin development in sheared margin settings (Module 1). Synthesis of this knowledge combined with Phase 1 insights will be used to tackle the mechanisms and factors controlling depositional systems of sheared margin settings (Module 2). Both modules 1 and 2 feed into development of the thermal models characterizing the sheared margins affected by local magmatism, lower crustal flow, and development of models of systematics of the source rock maturation history patterns typical for sheared margins.",

Potentially large gas reserves; coupled with the present energy shortfall in South Africa, has led to shale gas becoming an attractive new energy prospect, with much of the renewed exploration focus falling on the Karoo Basin shales.\nThe project is designed to evaluate the gas potential of key carbonaceous shales within the Ecca and Dwyka Groups of the Karoo Basin; with integrated results used to define and evaluate the fundamental factors important to shale hydrocarbon potential in the Karoo Basin. A subsequent comparison of key parameters and results to analogous basins in North America will be used to identify areas with the greatest potential to viably host and produce shale gas within the Karoo.",

Improving these recoveries is extremely important for economic sustainability of producing liquids from shales. Our research in Phase 1 and 2 of Liquids from Shales (EGI reports I 00973) also showed that developing a comprehensive understanding of underlying processes and optimization requires integration of robust geological modeling, hydraulic fracturing representation, and accurate simulation of the stimulated reservoir volume.\nThis next generation of research is designed to develop tools for optimizing recovery of fluids in shales and identify improved recovery processes. Project tasks will be focused toward understanding creation, characterization and effect of stimulated reservoir volumes on improved liquid recoveries in unconventional reservoirs. Research will also be performed on understanding the overall logistics of development – hydraulic fracture spacing, well spacing, gas and water injection possibilities, for secondary recovery.",

    "body" : "With the current focus on liquids-rich shale plays in North America and the global importance of gas condensate plays, there is an increased need to develop reservoir engineering methods to analyze production data and to develop optimal methods of producing such reservoirs. Without careful planning a gas condensate reservoir can choke on its own production. Drawdown below the dew point of the reservoir fluid can result in condensate liquid dropout, particularly close to the wellbore, the sand face or the fracture face. The increased liquid saturation leads to reduced permeability to gas and, in some cases, significant choking back of the gas production. The impact on well production is most significant for shale reservoirs where most of the total pressure drop is in the formation. In recent EGI research projects (Shale Gas Production Analysis (SGPA) Phase 1 and Phase 2), we have developed a mathematical model of the gas production process from shales. In Phase 2 of that project we explored the applicability of the ideas developed in Phase 1 to production of saturated oil from shale reservoirs. The model developed provided no more than a first pass at analyzing the complex processes at play in this two-phase production system. Nevertheless the results were sufficiently encouraging that further development is warranted. In this project proposal we suggest that, first, an extension to gas condensate plays should be considered and second, a more detailed and rigorous mathematical analysis is merited.",

    "body" : "In addition to delivering the technical information in Phase 1, a further outcome was the signing of significant technical cooperation agreements with various governmental agencies and educational institutions in Colombia, Peru, Argentina and Brazil. These agreements allow for the exchange of technical expertise and data that includes previous interpretations, wells, seismic, samples and reservoir information.\nThe over-riding objective of Phase 2 is to comprehensively build on the knowledge, database, methodology, experience, contacts and signed agreements of Phase 1. It is the intention to establish an unparalleled understanding of shale resources in South America, enabling sponsors to make well informed exploration and exploitation decisions. Phase 2 research will follow two major avenues.\n\t-To collect a significant number of reservoir-specific core samples to enable extensive testing and measurements. It will also include an integrated interpretation involving seismic and well data.\n\t-To use the experience, methodologies and relationships developed in Phase 1, to evaluate an additional set of basins.

    "body" : "There are more than 10 hydrocarbon fields discovered on oceanic crust in the Gulf of Mexico and Gulf of Guinea. Current academic research indicates that there are several types of oceanic crust and each of them has very different thermodynamic history.\nWe are preparing a systematic manual on exploration in rift and passive margin regions and in the process improve the understanding of petroleum systems in these settings. Our new internal research is being merged with the results of current literature and we are striving to create a 500-page book titled “Rifts and Passive Margins— Structural Architecture, Thermal Regimes and Petroleum Systems” published by Cambridge University Press.\nOur target is to deliver our comprehensive manual by mid– to late 2013. The anticipated results are highly relevant to future successful exploration, the development of a new generation of exploration geologists, and enhanced internal training programs for oil companies.\t",

    "body" : "Compared to the U.S. Gulf of Mexico, West Africa margins, and the South Atlantic margin, the South China Sea (SCS) is an frontier exploration region. Based on Energy Information Administration (EIA) and U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) estimates, the SCS contains proven or probable reserves of approximately 11 billion barrels of oil (bbl) and 190 trillion cubic feet (Tcf ) of gas and may have an additional, undiscovered 12 bbl of oil and 160 Tcf of gas resources.\nRecent discoveries in Yinggehai Basin and Pearl River Mouth Basin located in the northern continental margin, Cuu Long in western SCS, and Reed Bank in southeastern SCS have spurred exploration efforts in the region. The current exploration status differs from basin to basin due to the variety of geologic settings, and a lack of regional studies to characterize the differences in those basins. The study objectives are to understand the regional tectonic and depositional evolution and petroleum systems in SCS.",

    "body" : "The production of liquids from shales has revolutionized the oil industry. In this second phase of research, we continued in our comprehensive quest at understanding all of the components that contribute to optimum exploitation of shales for liquids. These included geologic considerations, geomechanical modeling, reservoir engineering evaluations, and environmental aspects. We have learned and document that geologic characterization at various scales is important in establishing producibility and optimum recovery.\nSections 2–5 of the report focus on geologic evaluations. Detailed geologic characterizations of the Niobrara are discussed to establish the role of geology on production, the results have identified the property with the strongest correlation to production. An examination of pore-level characterization and a detailed workflow of shale characterization at the pore scale fill out the geology Sections.\nSections 6 –11 deal with various engineering operations. The material balance methodology utilized production data and fluids characterization. The method developed makes it possible to obtain pressure profiles and saturation information, and to estimate reservoir permeability prior to interference with another hydraulic fracture. The development of this method for all types of reservoir fluids, and associated data analysis technique, were significant achievements in this project. This analytical tool for matrix permeability determination is available to all sponsors.",

    "body" : "Currently, the ability to estimate OGIP or OOIP often exceeds the ability to economically stimulate and extract this resource. This applies to many tight as well as ultra-low permeability formations, i.e. sands or shales. Improved simulation of hydraulic stimulation, amalgamating geologic texture with controllable engineering parameters could be of value.\nAdvances in simulation capabilities enable coupling structural geologic data (three-dimensional representation of stresses, natural fractures, and stratigraphy) with decision making processes for stimulation – volumes, rates, fluid types, completion zones. Without this interaction between simulation capabilities and geological information, low permeability formation exploitation may linger on the fringes of real economic viability.\nDiagnosis and simulation of hydraulic stimulation should consider the tectonic setting, the uplift history, the inferred fracture and fault configurations, and the relative magnitude and orientation of the principal stresses (all three principal stresses) which can be used to optimize fracture geometry and stimulation programs. With improvements in software, computational capacity, and recognition that in-situ discontinuities are relevant, fully three-dimensional hydraulic simulation is now becoming possible.",

Sheared margins have a thermal history, which is different from that of extensional margins. Recent studies by EGI in the Equatorial Atlantic and Indian sheared margins have indicated that a successful exploration program in this setting requires a detailed understanding of the thermal and structural history of continental break-up.\nObjectives of this project are to refine the existing general timing of break-up of large margin segments with detailed break-up propagation timing, associated thermal histories, expulsion and trap timing. To achieve this, a robust analytical work program has been designed to focus on low-temperature thermochronology (constraining the exhumation histories of sedimentary provenances geared towards the first 10–40 Ma after break-up), fluid inclusions (constraining migration timing and migration horizons), and geochemical source rock\/hydrocarbons analyses (pairing source rock candidates with existing hydrocarbons). This effort will be undertaken in context with re-interpretation of existing dense and robust open-file well and seismic data within sheared margins.",

    "body" : "A significant body of work has been done on imaging the various gas and liquid producing shales. The images show the underlying heterogeneities and complexities that characterize shales. Implications of the observations at these scales on storage, thermodynamics and flow in shales are important, and are being examined by a number of groups.\rThe storage is conceptualized for various types of porosity – intergranular, intragranular, within the organic matter, etc. Complex pore structures that exist, for example in a Bakken shale sample are shown in Figure 1. Different types of measurements on prolific liquids producing shales indicate porosities of greater than 10%. The presence of this porosity is not easily evident from Figure 1. One\rof the questions is whether there is an underlying porosity in nanostructures of the shale samples. In a recent paper, Chen et al., (2013), observed that about 90% of the approximate 5% porosity is contained in pores smaller than 100 nm. Our work with fluorescent, epoxy-impregnated thin section studies have revealed underlying nanoporosity in chalks. In this project, we will create wellcalibrated\rnanoporous materials to help us figure out the roles of different types of porosity on permeabilities and relative permeabilities. We will compare results with measurements on natural shale samples.\rIn our previous work, we have shown that matrix permeability is one of the most important properties that govern recoveries of liquids from shales. Thermodynamic properties such as bubble and dew points, gas-oil ratios, etc., are also important. The low gas production in some of the liquids producing shales have been attributed to suppression of bubble or dew points in nanopores. It is thus critically important to understand the impact of the nanoporous structure on the basic properties of shales and fluids in these shales.\rThe GRI method of measuring permeability in shales consists of crushing the rock, exposing this to pressure and measuring pressure decay. It is not clear how this measurement corresponds to the connected liquid permeability in liquid-bearing shales. In this project, we will measure permeabilities by different methods to demonstrate and understand relationships between various permeability measurement techniques. Shales that produce liquids are under primary production. Even more important is that standard methods usually only provide absolute permeability.",

    "body" : "Commercial exploitation of low mobility gas reservoirs has been improved with multi-stage hydraulic fracturing of long horizontal wells. Favorable exploitation has been correlated with large fracture surface area in contact with the shale matrix – this surface area being created by high rate and high volume injection of low viscosity water-based fluids. The environmental and economic implications of using large volumes of water (millions of gallons per well) are attracting considerable stakeholder and regulatory attention. Beyond this, ROI is usually unacceptable with the current pricing for natural gas.\nImprovements can be anticipated with reduced volume stimulations. Two avenues of approach are envisioned:\n\t-Modify properties of the fracturing fluid to facilitate flowback from unpropped secondary fracture networks, or\n\t\t−Modify the properties of the fracturing fluid to reduce the rate at which it flows into the secondary fracture network and still provide a nominally undamaged fracture system.\n\t\tIn the short-term, modifications can be made to operating practices that cater the treatment fluid to the specific reservoir. This involves optimizing fluid-rock compatibility decision making protocols. Fracture face damage, large capillary retention, relative permeability blockage of secondary and tertiary fractures can be reduced. Experimental and analytical evaluations are proposed – with the goal of providing tools and methodologies for fluid selection. In the long-term, alternate treating fluids may be the key to improved treatment efficiency. This can include revisiting fluids that the industry is familiar with – for example, CO2 – and using specialty fluids that have not been economically viable in the past – for example, gelled propane. Any and all of these potential solutions relate to characterizing mechanisms for formation damage, generally associated with diffusive or mechanical interactions between treating fluid, formation fluid and the formation rock itself. The Energy & Geosciences Institute will collaborate with Constien & Associates to provide an integrated numerical, analytical and experimental program to clarify mechanisms for this damage and to infer solutions. Unique experimental testing will complement state-of-the-art coupled geomechanical reservoir simulations, to delineate solutions that will reduce volumes, increase treatment NPV and reduce environmental concerns.

    "body" : "Since the early 1980s, EGI has been developing environmentally benign, affordable and conservative tracers for geothermal, petroleum, and ground-water applications. Recently, EGI successfully demonstrated the use of reactive (e.g. reversibly sorbing) tracers in both packed-column, laboratory experiments and in field tracer tests. These are tracers that sorb and desorb rapidly and whose passage through a formation is therefore slightly retarded relative to that of a conservative (e.g. non-sorbing) tracer. The retardation is a function of the surface area of the rock to which the tracer solution was exposed.\nIn combination with appropriately calibrated numerical models, conservative and sorbing tracers can be used during the hydrofracture of shale formations to calculate the contacted fracture surface area and thereby to measure the success of the hydrofracture treatment. This approach has been successfully demonstrated in a geothermal reservoir and was again used in a shale-gas hydrofracture at the Dilly Creek (Horn River) project in northeast British Columbia during the summer of 2013. Data from the field experiment are still being analyzed, but the presentation will show recent results of laboratory experiments using a newly fabricated injection\/ backflow reactor that simulates a shale-gas-hydrofracture and flow-back process.",
